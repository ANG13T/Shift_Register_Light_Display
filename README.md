## How It Work

This project utilizes a 74HC595 shift register to make a quick display with five LEDs.

### Why should you use a shift register
Shift registers provide extra I/O pins for a microcontroller with a limited amount of I/O pins. The 74HC595 shift register is a SIPO (Serial-In-Parallel-Out) chip which is utilized when there is a demand for a many outputs such as LEDs.
